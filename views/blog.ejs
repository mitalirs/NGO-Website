                Indian Red Cross has scaled up preparedness to tackle the Coronavirus Pandemic by initiating a myriad of activities. In the initial phase of the outbreak, volunteers were trained, awareness & prevention programs were conducted to sensitize people & vulnerable communities.

Mass gatherings, that expose people to greater health risks during public health emergency situations were targeted. Volunteers reached vulnerable people at locations such as railway stations to educate them on prevention & spread of COVID2019.</p>
